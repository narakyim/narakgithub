      <p>Iâ€™m <strong>Sithongnarak Yim</strong> and you can call me Narak. Iâ€™m 13 yearsold. I was born in Takeo, Cambodia and I was raised in Phnom Penh since I was 5. Iâ€™m currently living and learning in Liger Leadership Academy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

        <strong>Six Core Values</strong> has been sticking with me since I came to Liger. <strong>Determination</strong> is what best describes me. I like working alone and sometimes disappear (doesnâ€™t talk much) from the world for like a whole day because I was investing all my time to the computer.</p>

        I like doing this because it made me feel <strong>confident</strong> about my skills and I donâ€™t need anyone to help me with any tasks. This doesnâ€™t make me feel selfish because I also enjoy being around people but I also need my personal time. The feeling of freedom and being <strong>independent</strong> is what I always wanted.

      <p>
        I do want some help sometimes with tasks or work but I always find myself being myself and achieving things that others canâ€™t get alone.
        
        Until now, Iâ€™m always trying to <strong>understand</strong> myself more. I wanted to be a <strong>software engineer</strong> but I also donâ€™t want staying in front of a screen everyday. I wanted live my life at full potential and see what can I achieve further on.
